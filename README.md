# Ecosystem-Simulation
It is a simulation of an ecosystem ðŸ˜®

wow someone really clicked on this????

so its a work in progress, i started making this as an idea for an ESS IA but it turned into something big

currently mad at pygame --> open to suggestions for any other graphic library (not tkinter pls i just want something easy) to replace it

how it works /// what it does???

there are agents that interact with one another (bet): 

- the environment aka the grass
- a q-learning style neural network class
- instances of a creature class that inherit the neural network class
- a grid for creatures to move in / eat others / reproduce (yknow like an ecosystem)

i tried to make a launcher with a chmod shell script but had problems with different systems installing pygame in different locations (smh my head pygame)

if mac_launcher.sh doesn't work for you:
a) you might be on windows (could be)
b) you are opening it with an editor instead of terminal
c) pygame was installed elsewhere so just do python3 Controler.py on terminal or smth

dependencies:

- tensorflow2
- python3
- pygame (duh)
- numpy

don't hesitate to comment about any feedback / spelling mistakes / friend requests / personal attacks

not that i'll be getting any ðŸ˜¢
